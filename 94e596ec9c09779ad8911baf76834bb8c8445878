But I\u0027m not intimately familiar with other places where UID_SELF gets used/exposed (I see KeyGenParameterSpec.getUid() returns this and in this case \"caller itself\" could be the right definition) so this could be wrong.",

      "message": "Sorry, I\u0027m having a hard time understanding what you\u0027d like the javadoc to say.  It already says that UID_SELF corresponds to NAMESPACE_APPLICATION, and it links to the documentation for NAMESPACE_APPLICATION which explains how NAMESPACE_APPLICATION works.  It also says that new code should work with Keystore namespaces directly.  Note that before this CL, UID_SELF was undocumented.  I think maybe you are asking for some detail about KeyChain specifically?  As I mentioned UID_SELF isn\u0027t really specific to KeyChain though, as it\u0027s simply an alias for NAMESPACE_APPLICATION (as my proposed javadoc says).  E.g., querying the legacy UID of any key in NAMESPACE_APPLICATION will return UID_SELF.\n\nIt\u0027s indeed confusing to have the concept of these legacy UIDs alongside the newer mechanism (namespaces), but removing the concept of legacy UIDs is not the point of this topic.  I was going to do that originally, but it turned into way too many changes, so I ended up just going with a renaming for now so that we can close out b/326508120.",
