      "message": "I spoke to Alex and ruminated overnight.\n\nFor a similar change for OkHttp, Alex and Jesse settled on UnknownServiceException.\n\nAlex also mentioned SecurityException. I prefer IOException in this case. On Android, RuntimeExceptions tend to reach the top of the call stack and kill the app. If people right now deal with IOException by reporting a nice error to the user then they will continue to do so.\n\nI am not convinced this feature will \"stick\" or be widely used. I don\u0027t know where it might go next. I want to consider deprecation and evolution.\n\nAlex might want to add extra information to the exception outside of the message: the attempted URL. I am not convinced of the need.\n\nAdding a new exception to Android\u0027s APIs is costly for the value it\u0027s adding. The vast majority of people won\u0027t actually want to catch this or care about it. Throwing any android.* exception form libcore is going to involve reflection. I\u0027m not against reflection if we can\u0027t avoid it but I\u0027d like to try.\n\nMy order of preference:\n\n1) Throwing an existing subclass of IOException (e.g. UnknownServiceException, ProtocolException)\nPros: Avoids adding more cruft to the Android APIs, avoids making 3rd party library code (e.g. http stacks or intermediate layers) know about Android APIs. Future evolution could involve moving to (2) or (3) below.\nCons: Not a 100% fit to our existing comments on those classes. No ability to add extra info.\n\n2) Throwing an Android API subclass of, e.g. UnknownServiceException, ProtocolException.\nPros: People can either code to Android API or java.net APIs if they want.\nCons: Android API grows for a niche feature. Unbundled http-stacks / libs either code to android APIs or do their own thing.\n\n3) Throwing a non-public, immediate subclass of e.g. UnknownServiceException, ProtocolException.\nPros: Can still be named appropriately, but people don\u0027t have to code to Android APIs if they don\u0027t want to.\nCons: No ability to add extra info. Reflection involved from libcore. Unbundled http-stacks have to do their own thing (probably throw UnknownServiceException, ProtocolException or their own subclass).\n\n4) Throwing a non-public, immediate subclass of IOException \nPros: None I can think of.\nCons: No ability for code to catch this case in a \"nice\" way so no decent chance of special handling.",
