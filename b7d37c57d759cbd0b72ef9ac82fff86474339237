      "message": "\"Capabilities that are accessible\"\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u0027t use the word \"accessible\" here, because this is not a security property, it only affects what is visible by default in NetworkCallbacks.\n\nFor the same reason, I think \"despite\" is not the right word either. As best I can understand, this should be:\n\n/**\n * Capabilities that are currently incompatible with VCN networks and thus require that the\n * NOT_VCN_MANAGED not be present in NetworkRequests.\n */\nprivate static final long VCN_UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES \u003d \n        ...;\n\nEven if we do that rename, though, I don\u0027t think this is a good approach. Explicitly enumerating the capabilities here is brittle and is likely to break as soon as telephony adds a new network capability, which happens every now and again. I think we\u0027re better off enumerating the capabilities that the VCN *is* capable of, and having the opposite list.\n\nBy doing an intersection between this list and the list of capabilities, I think that basically just boils down to two: INTERNET and DUN.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest: why can\u0027t we live with something much simpler, i.e.:\n\n- If a request doesn\u0027t request INTERNET or DUN: no need to do anything.\n- If a request requests INTERNET or DUN, add the NOT_VCN_MANAGED bit.",

If you say that this capability has to be always set by default for agents, than changes in the future when, say, some telephony agent comes in. The answer to that kind of question is always going to be \"yeah but it\u0027s a telephony agent so it MUST know to remove it !\"... and yeah I could make the exact opposite argument and be the exact same amount of right. Also remember that your \"correct\" is somebody else\u0027s \"incorrect\", as has been exemplified literally countless times during the design of the VCN.\n\nIn practice the simple fact is that adding capabilities like NOT_VCN is a mess in particular because the simpler solution is, by far, to go and touch all the network factories. Making a \"default agent\" implementation is deceptively tempting, but it actually complexify things, because every time you add anything you still have to think about each individual agent but you have to reckon with whatever the \"default\" implementation of the agent is doing on top of the default capabilities implementation, so it\u0027s even worse. Not as bad as actually adding one to the default caps, which at this point I think is downright untractable.\n\n\nEdit (this was written some time ago) : changed strategies.",
