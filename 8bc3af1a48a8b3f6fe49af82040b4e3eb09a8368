CTS? unit?\n\nI became aware that NotificationManagerServiceTest are failing when launched on user driver.\nThey pass if run with \"--user 0\".\n\nI made a CL not to hardcode the context user id running the test.\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/1623839\n\nIn the end, if it fixes TreeHugger checks, it can be squashed with this CL\n\n",
