Not sure if you already had this discussion with @winsonc@google.com?\n\nIf you\u0027re open to moving it and keeping the flags directory for aconfig, are any of the following an option:\n\n- frameworks/base/core/java/android/window/\n- frameworks/base/core/java/android/window/utils/\n- frameworks/base/core/java/android/window/desktop/",
