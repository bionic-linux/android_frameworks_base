      "message": "1) I mean that ep1 and ep2 are removed not from mEndpointList but files removed from directory /dev/usb-ffs/adb/. You can check it with \"while true; do ls; done\" and switching data transfer modes very fast. You\u0027ll see that ep1 and ep2 are not present in directory when switching is happen.\n\n2) The TRUE way to fix the order is to add tearDownGadget function into the Usb Gadget intergace (it\u0027ll be more logical because now setCurrentUsbFunctions does two logical works - tearing down and setting).\nIn this case it\u0027ll be possible to kick all existing connections by calling tearDownGadget, then start/stop adb and then setting the current function in Usb Gadget HAL as it works now without Gadget HAl.\n\nBut for now my patch can fix this problem of order. I saw in UsbDeviceManager implementation without HAL there was a try to remove setting configfs to NONE everytime switching is happen, but then that commit was revert, so I can make a conclusion this order must be observed.\n\n3) Our implementation is the same as yours, even logs. Please find our log attached below when my patch is merged.
