      "message": "The locking here is difficult to follow. In particular I think the use of mConnected without taking the lock is suspicious. I can\u0027t easily tell whether it\u0027s correct. It *might* be correct because of how all the surrounding code works, but even if it is, that isn\u0027t great because it will be very difficult for folks touching this code in the future to keep it correct.\n\nOut of curiosity: instead of doing this in the client, which has a very difficult threading model (most calls can be called on whatever thread the app wants), did you consider doing it in the service? That might be easier because everything runs on the same thread. It might be more complex to get all the state transitions right, though. I think you\u0027d basically have to start the daemon every time the first client asks the service to do something, and have the service send itself a message to stop the daemon every time removeRequestMap removes the last in-flight ID. Unfortunately you can\u0027t just start the daemon in storeRequestMap, because that is only called once the daemon has accepted a command.\n\nMaybe you could have:\n- A maybeStopDaemon methods that sends a message to the handler to stop the daemon if mIdToClientInfoMap is empty\n- A maybeStartDaemon method that starts the daemon if mIdToClientInfoMap is empty (and removes the messages to stop the daemon).\n\nThen you could call maybeStartDaemon in registerService, discoverServices, resolveService, updateService, and call maybeStopDaemon in removeRequestMap. If the existing refcounting is correct, then this should work. If it\u0027s not... I don\u0027t know what will happen.\n\nAlso, if registerService, discoverServices, resolveService, or updateService fail, then you\u0027d have to stop the daemon.\n\nNot sure whether it\u0027s better to try to fix the locking in this CL or to attempt to do this in the service. Generally speaking doing it in the service seems more appropriate than in a manager class running in application process and that can be killed at any time, but it\u0027s true that doing it in the service seems like a bigger change.",

      "message": "What about threading? CountDownLatch is a synchronization primitive, so it\u0027s designed and expected to be used on multiple threads. But the mConnected member itself is not thread-safe because it\u0027s not volatile. If this member is thread-safe because it\u0027s only used under lock, then that should be stated here in a comment, or, better yet, using an @GuardedBy annotation. If it\u0027s not thread-safe, then that sounds like a bug.\n\nAlso: pre-existing, but since you\u0027re changing this code... calling this member \"mConnected\" makes it sound like it represents whether the service is connected. But it\u0027s actually a latch that tracks... well, something. Maybe call it mConnectedLatch?\n\nFWIW, there\u0027s no need to explicitly initialize to null here. That\u0027s guaranteed by the Java language spec.\n\nYou might well observe that if I had read the whole file I would have the answers to all the above questions. That is probably true. But I think it\u0027s important that someone looking at this code does not need to read the whole file in order to know these things. Also, the annotation has value in itself, because it makes it very clear to anyone touching or reviewing the code (or even to automated tools such as errorprone) that the member must never be touched without the lock.\n\nFinally - it would be good to explain what this is for and how it is used. Something like:\n\n    // Used to wait for mAsyncChannel to be connected.",
