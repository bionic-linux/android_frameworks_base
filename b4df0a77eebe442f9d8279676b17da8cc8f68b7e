So no threading concerns with accessing mPowerManager.\n- Order between onAddressAllocated and systemReady is not guaranteed\n- If system is not yet ready, boot will be interpreted as quiescent boot\n\nMy question is, if boot is mistakenly considered quiescent, what are the effects and how do you recover?\nCan we make this more deterministic (guarantee onAddressAllocated happens after systemReady)?",

      "message": "As we discussed, there are actually some threading issues with accessing PowerManager in HdmiControlService before systemReady(). I will file a bug to keep track of those. Let\u0027s find a fix for the present issue, without fixing all the threading issues, as Amlogic is waiting for a solution for this.\n\nVenkat will investigate the order in which onAddressAllocated and onBootPhase(PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICES_READY) are called. If generally onAddressAllocated() happens after onBootPhase(PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICES_READY), I don\u0027t have a concern with merging this change.\n\nOne thing this change doesn\u0027t consider, is the case where quiescent mode is exited and we continue as a regular boot, because a power or wake key was pressed. This is really an edge case, and quiescent boots are timed to avoid users wanting to use their devices at that time. It should be fine to not consider this case, but we can still add it as a comment.\n\nOn a final note, it would probably be possible to switch calls around and only turn on system audio mode, or query the network for who\u0027s active source at a later time, avoiding the threading issues and considering the case where we exit quiescent mode. However, we don\u0027t actively maintain the audio system CEC implementation and don\u0027t have a soundbar device to test this on. Therefore, this would be a risky change to make, potentially doing more harm than good.",

      "message": "By \"no threading issues\" I meant that the member mPowerManager is not being accessed from multiple threads, but only ever from the single \"Service Thread\" (otherwise you\u0027d have to synchronize access to the member).\n\nAssuming all accesses to mPowerManager happen on the service thread (quick check suggests that is indeed the case), we don\u0027t have to worry about synchronization.\nThis alone does not guarantee a certain ordering of operations however, since messages/Runnables can be posted to HdmiControlService\u0027s Handler at different times, depending on eg. when CEC events are received.\n\nHdmiControlService\u0027s \"service thread\" is the SystemServer\u0027s main thread.\nHdmiControlService\u0027s Handler attaches to the main thread\u0027s Looper.\nLooking back at how SystemServer.java initializes services, I believe that systemReady must always come before anything posted on HdmiControlService\u0027s Handler is executed: SystemServer\u0027s startup is single-threaded, it starts one service after another, and proceeds into the PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICES_READY afterwards. Since this all happens procedurally on a single thread, it must complete this work before the main thread becomes free to start work on anything posted to the Handler.\nSystemServer starts looping its Looper only after boot is completed.\nSince onAddressAllocated is dispatched to that Looper, it can only be executed after SystemServer has finished boot.\n\nTherefore I\u0027m no longer concerned about mPowerManager not yet being ready in onAddressAllocated.\n\nThat also means that this `isQuiescentBoot` is never actually called *during* quiescent boot, but only after bootComplete. PowerManager processes PHASE_BOOT_COMPLETED before HdmiControlService does, and in case of a quiescent boot puts the device to sleep.\nSo at the time of `onAddressAllocated` being called, `isInteractive() \u0026\u0026 displayState \u003d\u003d STATE_OFF` shouldn\u0027t actually occur anymore - that only happens *during* quiescent boot. (Was this tested performing a quiescent boot on an actual device? Was this condition ever observed in `onAddressAllocated`?)\n\nInstead, can you just check `isInteractive()` alone? I assume there\u0027s no reason to turn on system audio mode when the device is asleep?",

When the looper only starts accepting work after PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICES_READY, does that mean that mPowerManager will be initialized by the time onAddressAllocated gets called? The tests currently will still fail, but we can call onBootPhase(PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICES_READY) to fix that.\n\nWe still need to mention that the edge case of exiting quiescent boot between PHASE_SYSTEM_SERVICE_READY and PHASE_BOOT_COMPLETED isn\u0027t covered.",
